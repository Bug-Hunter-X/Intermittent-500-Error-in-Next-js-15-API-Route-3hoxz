# Intermittent 500 Error in Next.js 15 API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js 15 API route where a 500 Internal Server Error is thrown intermittently. The issue stems from a race condition within an asynchronous operation.

## Bug Description

The API route simulates an asynchronous operation (using `setTimeout`) that randomly returns either a successful response (200 OK) or a 500 error.  This randomness makes the error hard to debug, as it doesn't appear consistently. This is a common issue when dealing with asynchronous operations and improper error handling in API routes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Make multiple GET requests to `/api/data`. You'll observe that some requests will return a 500 error while others return a successful 200 response.

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling potential errors within the asynchronous operation and ensuring the response is sent even if an error occurs.
